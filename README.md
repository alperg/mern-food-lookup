# mern-food-lookup
This is a food nutrition lookup application that demonstrates the setup generated by `create-react-app` alongside a Node Express API server with MongoDB & Mongoose. The data driving the app is supplied by the USDA's National Nutrient Database.

## Running locally

```
git clone https://github.com/alperg/mern-food-lookup
cd mern-food-lookup
npm i

cd client
npm i

cd ..
npm start
```

## Overview

`create-react-app` configures a Webpack development server to run on `localhost:3000`. This development server will bundle all static assets located under `client/src/`. All requests to `localhost:3000` will serve `client/index.html` which will include Webpack's `bundle.js`.

To prevent any issues with CORS, the user's browser will communicate exclusively with the Webpack development server.

Inside `Client.js`, we use Fetch to make a request to the API:

```js
// Inside Api.js
return fetch(`/api/food?q=${query}`, {
  // ...
})
```

This request is made to `localhost:3000`, the Webpack dev server. Webpack will infer that this request is actually intended for our API server. We specify in `package.json` that we would like Webpack to proxy API requests to `localhost:3001`:

```js
// Inside client/package.json
"proxy": "http://localhost:3001/",
```

This handy features is provided for us by `create-react-app`.

Therefore, the user's browser makes a request to Webpack at `localhost:3000` which then proxies the request to our API server at `localhost:3001`:

This setup provides two advantages:

1. If the user's browser tried to request `localhost:3001` directly, we'd run into issues with CORS.
2. The API URL in development matches that in production. You don't have to do something like this:

```js
// Example API base URL determination in Client.js
const apiBaseUrl = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'localhost:3001' : '/'
```

This setup uses [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) for process management. Executing `npm start` instructs `concurrently` to boot both the Webpack dev server and the API server.

## Deploying

### Background

The app is ready to be deployed to Heroku.

Inside `server.js`, we tell Node/Express we'd like it to serve static assets in production:

```
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
	const path = require('path');
	app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/build/static')));
}
```

You just need to have Webpack produce a static bundle of the React app for Heroku to render your client app.
